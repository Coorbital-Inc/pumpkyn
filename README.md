# ðŸŽƒPumpkyn Toolbox

**Pumpkyn** is an open-source MATLAB toolbox for exploring and analyzing tulip-shaped orbits in the Earthâ€“Moon Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP). It provides a hands-on environment for generating, propagating, and diagnosing periodic orbit families that are relevant to cislunar navigation, communications, and science missions.

### ðŸ“š Tutorials
The toolbox includes guided Live Script tutorials located in the `/docs` folder:
| Tutorial | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| [**Extracting Tulip-Shaped Orbits and Properties**](./toolbox/docs/md/intro_tulip.md) | Generates tulip orbits in the Earthâ€“Moon CR3BP. Retrieves full orbit families for a chosen petal count and computes properties such as Jacobi constant, stability index, perilune/apolune altitudes, and lunar occultation. |
| [**Creating a Pumpkin Orbit**](./toolbox/docs/md/intro_pumpkyn.md) | Generates, propagates, and visualizes a 13-petal pumpkin-shaped orbit. Computes stability index, Jacobi constant, and altitude extremes to assess orbit stability and suitability for cislunar operations. |
| [**Zero-Velocity Surface Analysis**](./toolbox/docs/md/zeroVelocity.md) | Visualizes zero-velocity surfaces for a chosen Jacobi constant and overlays a 9-petal tulip orbit (C = 3.1777). Illustrates how energy level determines accessibility through L1 and confinement near the Moon. |
| [**Station-Keeping Estimation Demonstration**](./toolbox/docs/md/stationKeepingEst.md) | Estimates Î”V requirements for maintaining a pumpkin-shaped orbit. Applies linear-stability theory to compute upper and lower Î”V bounds for various correction intervals, providing insight into maneuver frequency and annual maintenance costs. |
| [**Pseudo-Arclength Continuation (Tulips â†’ Pumpkins)**](./toolbox/docs/md/tulipContinuation.md) | Extends a tulip orbit using pseudo-arclength continuation. Starting from a seed orbit, the routine traces new family members across increasing sidereal periods, visualizing geometric evolution from tulip to pumpkin. |
| [**Finding Unstable Manifolds**](./toolbox/docs/md/manifolds.md) | Computes and visualizes invariant manifolds departing from a periodic tulip orbit. Highlights dynamical pathways that enable low-energy transfers and natural escape/capture trajectories. |
| [**Designing a Tulip-Shaped Constellation**](./toolbox/docs/md/tulipContinuation.md) | Builds a time-phased constellation along a multi-petal tulip orbit in the CR3BP rotating frame, illustrating constellation design for persistent lunar coverage or SDA missions. |
| [**Minimum-Energy Transfers**](./toolbox/docs/md/minEnergy.md) | Estimates the minimum Î”V required for a tulip-orbit spacecraft to reach the lunar surface. Maps energy contours to reveal optimal access regions and low-energy transfer opportunities. |
| [**Coordinate Transformations: J2000 â†” CR3BP**](./toolbox/docs/md/j2k2cr3bp.md) | Demonstrates conversion between Moon-centered inertial and barycentric rotating frames. Bridges classical two-body dynamics with multi-body CR3BP analysis for integrated mission design. |
| [**Lunar Surface Coverage Analysis**](./toolbox/docs/md/surfCoverage.md) | Simulates a tulip-orbit constellation and computes lunar surface coverage based on a minimum elevation angle. Plots maximum uncovered-gap times to evaluate communications and sensing performance. |
| [**Lunar South Pole GDOP Analysis**](./toolbox/docs/md/intro_gdop.md) | Computes geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) at the lunar south pole for a 7-petal, 6:5-resonant tulip constellation. Evaluates navigation geometry and PNT performance over time. |
